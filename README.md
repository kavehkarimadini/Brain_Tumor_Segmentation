**Brain Tumor Segmentation with U-Net on the BITE Dataset Using PyTorch**

Brain tumor segmentation plays a vital role in medical image analysis, enabling accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient monitoring. In recent years, deep learning—particularly convolutional neural networks—has shown exceptional performance in this area. Among them, the **U-Net architecture** stands out as a leading model for biomedical image segmentation due to its encoder-decoder structure with skip connections that allow precise, pixel-level predictions.

In this work, we utilize **U-Net implemented in PyTorch** to perform brain tumor segmentation on the **BITE (Brain Images of Tumors for Evaluation)** dataset. The BITE dataset provides annotated MRI scans of brain tumors, designed specifically for evaluating segmentation techniques in a real-world clinical context.

Our approach includes preprocessing the BITE dataset (e.g., normalization and augmentation), training the U-Net with loss functions like Dice loss or binary cross-entropy, and evaluating model performance using metrics such as the Dice coefficient. PyTorch offers the flexibility and scalability needed for building, training, and fine-tuning such deep learning models effectively.

This implementation demonstrates how U-Net, with its robust architecture and efficient learning capabilities, can be applied to the BITE dataset to achieve accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation.
